 LO:
Understand the concept of subroutines
Learn how to write simple procedures and functions
Understand and use parameters to pass data to procedures and functions
Know that subroutines may use local variables which are accessible only within the subroutine
Use local variables and explain why it is good practice to do so
Explain the advantages of using subroutines in programs
 
Task 1
(a)    How many parameters does procedure printInfo have?  3 
        procedure printInfo(firstname, surname, age)
            fullName = firstname + " " + surname
       years = str(age) + " years old."
		print(fullName)
		print(years)
        endprocedure
	 
	 
	 
(b)    What will be printed by the following call to the procedure? 
        printInfo("Mickey", "Mouse", 92)
	Output: 
	Mickey Mouse
	92 years old.
	 
	 
Task 2
Write a function called answerYorN to input and check the response to a question. It should be “y” or “n”. Any other response is invalid, and the function should ask the user to re-enter until a valid response is received. The function will then return “y” or “n” when a valid response is received.
The subroutine is called as follows:
        response = answerYorN()

yorn = str(input("are you in school right now (answer y or n) "))
def answerYorN(): 
    if yorn == "y" : 
        ans = "good boy" 
    else: 
        ans = "get to school"
    print(ans)
response = answerYorN()



 
Task 3
Write a function called addIntegers which takes two integers. The function needs to add up all the numbers between the first number and last number and return the result.
For example addIntegers(5,10) will return 45
def addIntegers(a, b):
    total = 0
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        total += i
    return total

print(addIntegers(5, 10))


Task 4
1.    (a)    What is printed out when the following program is run? The total price of all of the prices of the items 
	    function calculateTotal(prices)
	        total = 0
	        for i = 0 to prices.length
	            total = total + prices[i]
	        next i
	        return total
	    endfunction
	 
	    quantity = 5
	    itemPrices = [2.00, 2.50, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00]
	    totalPrice = calculateTotal(itemPrices)
	    print(totalPrice)
	    
	
	 
	 

 
	(b)    Name two local variables used inside the calculateTotal function. What is the scope of each of these variables?
	Total. Prices, 
	 
	 
	 
2.    Examine the following pseudocode.
	function triangle(base, height)
	    halfBase = base / 2
		area = halfbase * height   
	endfunction
	 
	#main program
	area = triangle(8, 10) -area2 = triangle(8 , 10)
	print(area)            -print(area2)

	 
	The pseudocode contains an error.
Find the error and write a line of code to fix it.
