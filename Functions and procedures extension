Q1
A shop offers a discount on items. Create a function called calculate_sale_price. The function should:
	• Take two parameters: original_price (float) and discount_percent (integer).
	• Calculate the new price by removing the percentage from the original price.
	• Return the new price.
(Example: If inputs are 100.00 and 20, the function returns 80.00)
def calculate_sale_price(original_price , discount_percentage):
    new_price = original_price * (discount_percentage / 100)
    return new_price
original_price = float(input("enter the price of the item"))
discount_percentage = int(input("enter the discount as a percentage(without the percentage sign) "))
complete_price = calculate_sale_price(original_price , discount_percentage)
print(complete_price)
    
Q2
A theme park charges different ticket prices based on age. Write a function called get_ticket_cost. The function should:
	• Take age (integer) as a parameter.
	• If the age is under 5, return 0.
	• If the age is between 5 and 17 (inclusive), return 10.
	• If the age is 18 or older, return 20.
 
def get_ticket_cost (age):
    if age < 5:
        return 0 
    elif age >= 5 and age <= 17 : 
        return 10 
    elif age >=18: 
        return 20 
age2 = int(input("enter age"))
ticket_cost = get_ticket_cost(age2)
print("ticket price: £" ,ticket_cost)
